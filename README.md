# Recommendation-System
This project aims to develop an automatic recommendation system capable of providing personalized suggestions based on user behavior and preferences. As a data analyst at getINNOtized, I will leverage past user interactions, preferences, and other relevant features to build a robust system that can be applied to various domains, including e-commerce, media, and subscription-based platforms. The goal is to enhance user satisfaction, increase engagement, and drive business value through intelligent, personalized recommendations.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Methodology

- Tools

Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Dask, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib & Seaborn, GitHub, Git.

- Methodology

The entire project will follow the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, ensuring a structured and systematic approach from problem definition to final deployment.


üéØ Business Problem & Analytical Questions

- How many unique visitors per day/week?

- What patterns exist in user-item interactions over time?

- Which items have the highest property values overall?
 
- Which properties occur most frequently across items?

- Which visitors interacted with the highest number of unique items?

- What are the most frequently interacted items across all visitors?

- How do the types of events vary across items and visitors?

üíæ Data

The dataset for this project can be accessed via the folder named: Dataset. The data documentation has been read and understood to inform the data cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling stages. The dataset contains historical user interactions, which will be the foundation for building the recommendation system.

üìà CRISP-DM Framework

1. Business Understanding
This phase involved defining the project's objectives, identifying the business problem, and formulating the analytical questions outlined above. The primary goal is to build a recommendation system that provides personalized, accurate, and relevant suggestions.

2. Data Understanding and Preparation
This stage will involve:
    - Loading the dataset and performing initial exploratory data analysis
      (EDA).
    - Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
    - Extensive feature engineering to create new variables that will
      enhance the model's predictive power.
    - Creating a user-item interaction matrix, which is a crucial component
      for collaborative filtering methods.

4. Modeling and Evaluation:
This is the core of the project where I will develop the recommendation system.
    - Modeling: I will explore different machine learning techniques, such as collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based) and potentially content-based filtering or a hybrid approach.

    - Evaluation: The model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as Precision, Recall, and AUC (Area Under the Curve), to measure its effectiveness.

4. Results and Conclusions:

The final phase will involve summarizing the key insights from the analysis, answering the initial business questions, and providing actionable recommendations. The conclusions will highlight the potential business impact of the recommendation system and suggest future improvements.
